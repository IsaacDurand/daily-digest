# daily-digest

## Background
When I lived in the Bay Area, I commuted to work on Caltrain. It took me about 20 minutes to get home - a perfect amount of time for me to journal about the day's events. In particular, I'd write about what I had enjoyed doing most at work that day and what I'd enjoyed least. Over time, I saw patterns emerge, and I started to get a better sense of what kind of work I wanted to do going forward. In fact, this journaling played a crucial role in my decision to transition to a career in software engineering.

Now that I live in LA, I don't ride Caltrain any more - I either drive or walk to work. While I love the chance to listen to the news or get some exercise during my commute, I miss the routine of journaling. To encourage me to get back into this habit, I'm building an app that will remind me to journal every day and store my responses.
